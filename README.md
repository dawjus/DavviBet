This project involves developing the backend for a sports betting website. It is currently in progress and aims to become a fully functional sports betting application. The envisioned features include:

- User Account Management

## Completed Tasks

The following tasks have been completed:

- Implementation of basic functionalities necessary for the application to operate.
- Users can create accounts and place bets.
- Admins can add matches, events, and mark events as either won or lost.
- Coupons are automatically evaluated as won if all events are won, or as lost if at least one event is lost.

## Upcoming Tasks

In the near future, the project will focus on:

- Completing all remaining functionalities.
- Establishing a more detailed role-based access control system for admin, regular users, and unauthenticated users.
- Implementing login authorization.
- Conducting testing to ensure the application's stability and reliability.
- Handling exceptions, including negative account balances.
- Adding a simple frontend interface.

## Long-term Goals

Looking further ahead, the project will consider:

- Incorporating a demo with examples showcasing the application's functionality.
- Expanding the application's capabilities, potentially integrating real payment processing and a user forum.
- Enhancing the frontend design and usability.
